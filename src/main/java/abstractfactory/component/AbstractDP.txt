Abstract Design Pattern is one of the Creational Design Pattern
Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us with a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern.
So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.

Few examples
    1. Button and checkBox for mac and Windows
    2. Car models and production in different countries - incomplete
    3. Computer, PC and Servers factory
    4. Chair, Sofa, CoffeeTable Furniture and Victorian and modern types

Factory DP says Factory method is  a method in interface that returns instance of another specific class or subclass.
